In this information age, no matter what you're trying to learn, the first crucial step is **learning how to ask questions**. If Google and Bing can solve your problem, don't bother others with it.

I have a friend who always likes to ask me extremely abstract questions (concrete ones are fine too, as long as they're easily answerable just by looking at the words, even though I know they mean something else). Especially when done through WeChat, it turns already inefficient communication into a grueling ordeal. She just drop a question that's pointless to ask and quickly open a new chat window, which ultimately benefits neither of us. I don't mean anything else by this, I just think that while abstract weirdos are fine in entertainment, in academics, one should be more specific no matter what. Don't be a riddler.
